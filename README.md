## Problem Statement
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant drop in 
revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is struggling to remain viable. 
To address this challenge, the company aims to develop a strategic business plan
to boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers. To prepare 
for the post-pandemic surge in bike demand, BoomBikes has hired a consulting 
firm to analyze the factors influencing demand for shared bikes in the American market.

The aim is to understand

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## Conclusions
- Temperature is the most significant factor positively impacting the business.
- Environmental conditions such as rain, humidity, windspeed, and cloudiness have a negative effect on the business.
- The company should address adverse weather conditions by developing solutions to protect users from rain.
- Bike demand peaks during winter and summer, with users generally avoiding bike rentals on rainy days or during rainy seasons.
- Bike rentals are notably higher on Saturdays compared to other days of the week.
- Bike rental demand in 2019 has significantly increased compared to 2018, indicating strong growth for Boom Bikes.
